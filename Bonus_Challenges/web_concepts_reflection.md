##Reflect on your learning by describing the terms below:

* **Browser:** A browser is the software on your computer that allows you to see and engage with the contents of websites and web applications.

* **DNS:** A DNS (Domain Name System) is basically a phone book of the internet. It contains all the IP addresses and their corresponding domain names. For example the IP address of www.devbootcamp.com is 104.25.133.17

* **Domain:** It's the unique name of a computer on the internet. There are two main pieces to every domain:

 1. **TLD:** Top Level Domain, that is the .com .gov .net etc.
 2. **Second Level Domain:** Is the actual name of the website. For example *hello.com* the *hello* would be the second level domain.

* **Internet:** The internet is a wire, everything that is connected to that wire is connected to the internet. Most people are connected to the internet inderectly through an ISP ( internet service provider ) and the ISP is connected directly to the internet.

* **IP address:** It's a computer's address on the internet. For example 127.0.0.1 Everything that is connected to the internet like your phone,laptop and gaming console has it's own unique IP address.

* **Web app:** A Web Application is a website that is dynamic and relies on a user input. Like Twitter or YouTube.

* **Web server:** Is a computer that can be accessed through the Internet.

* **Website:** A website is a static web page that displays information for the visitor, like text, picture, videos and links. It does not rely on user input.

* **World wide web:** The WWW is an information sharing application, built on top of the Internet and was developed in the 80's. It allows users to see and interact with web pages through a web browser.

##Explain how the internet displays your website after you push your changes:
After I push my changes the information I send is devided into packets and is sent to the website's IP address. The website recieves those packets and assembles them back together to the original piece of data that I sent.
Then depending on the file format (HTML for example) the web browser will display the page accordingly.

* **What 2 new things did you learn about the web?**

I learned the difference between websites and web applications, I didn't know there was a difference before, and I learned about DNS. I have heard the term DNS before but never actually knew what it is or what it does.

* **How did you feel when you saw your web page live?**

It felt pretty good, a little sence of excitment and accomplishment although it was something very basic and simple. You have got to start somewhere right? :)

* **Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?**

I didn't have any "AHA" moments persay, but I definitely feel much more knowledgable about what happens in the background of the Internet and the web!

* **Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic?**

No, I used the resources provided.
