        <h2>Version Control & Github</h2>
        <p>It's date night and you have offered to cook dinner for that special someone. It's just about ready   but it needs a dash more salt. You grab the salt shaker and start shaking and...whoops! The lid comes off and half the bottle pours into the pan! Your delicious dinner is ruined! Over-salted to the maximum! Don't you wish you could go back in time, just before you picked up the salt shaker, and make sure the lid is secured? You have just discovered the need for version control.</p>

        <p>While sadly impossible in the culinary world, version control is easy in software development and has long been a part of the dev process. So what exactly is version control? It is a type of system that allows developers to take and store "snapshots" of their software code at various times during a project. The initial benefit is the obvious one of being able to go back to previous versions of the project. This can be done for many reasons but the case that jumps to mind is to get back to a working version of the code if errors have arisen.</p>

        <h4>  Why use GitHub to store your code?</h4>

        <p>First of all because GitHub is AwEsOmE! It gives you a free backup to all your files and programs that you are working on. Say your computer gets stolen or your hard drive becomse corrupted, all you have to do after you buy a new machine is to log in to your GitHub account clone your repository to your machine and voilla, all your files and programs are right there so you can continue working! Another good reason is the opporunity for other people to see and work on your code and for you to see and work on other people's code, learn from each other, collaborate and work on projects together. </p>

      <aside>
        <p>According to the keepers of Git, so called 'Version Control Systems' started on local machines, meaning developers made backups inside their personal systems. This left backups vulnerable to crashes or other mishaps, and also made it harder to effectively collaborate. A solution was to create 'Centralized Version Control Systems', where a central server stores all the backups which are then accessed by users individually. This meant many people would all be able to work on a project at the same time. It did have a few drawbacks, namely the single failpoint of a central server and a dependency on network thruput for pushes and pulls of files. Eventually another feature was added which provided more flexibility, speed and redundancy: users "cloned" the central backup to their systems, did work locally on their own branches, and then pushed the new files back up to the central server, to be joined back to the main branch. These are "Distributed Version Control Systems," of which Git is an example.</p>

  What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

We used <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <aside>, and <footer>
I will continue to use those tags because it's becoming the new standart for writing html, it helps me and others to clearly
see the code and understand it better when it's organized neatly into sections. It also helps people with disabilities
because screen readers understand the proper structure of your site better when using HTML5 semantic tags and elements.


How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

The elements are nested inside each other, and the browser displays them in the order they are written in the code. So if I have a <h2> tag followed by a <p>
tag, the browser will display the content of the <p> tag after the <h2> tag.


What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I already knew that Sublime is a very powerful tool, and yes I might create my own snippest in the future, but for now I will continue to use 'Emmet'
which is an amazing plugin for writing HTML5 in Sublime.
