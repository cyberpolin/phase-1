###How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
You can use it as a real-time manipulation tool, basically you can see all the changes as you type them in or edit them out, I think it is a really powerful tool that will save you time and will allow you to try different ideas without changing your source code. I will definitely make it a habbit to use it.


###How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
You can resize elements by adjusting the height and/or width of the element, or by adjusting the padding.

###What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

-**Static** is the default postion of every element.<br>
-**Fixed** is a position that will stay in place even if you scroll up and down in the browser, it will not move.<br>
-**Relative** is a position relative to where it would normally be positioned on the page.<br>
-**Absolute** is a position that is positioned in terms of the whole page. However, if there are other elements with a defined position then the absolute position will be positioned relative to the first parent element with a defined position.<br>
Static and fixed are obviously the easiest ones to use, there's not much to them. For me figuring out the relative and absolute positions was difficult.

###What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
Margin is the outer area of an element, padding is the inner area of the element, and border is the area between padding and margin.

###What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
For me this challenge was good and bad.<br>
Good because I feel like I learned a lot more about positioning and how to get more use out of the DevTools.<br>
Bad because I struggled with the positioning concept quite a lot and It was very frustrating.
