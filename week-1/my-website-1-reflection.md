**1. Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.**

https://aslonski.github.io/


**2. Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.**

To create a new repository you would log in to your GitHub account, click on the '+' sign next to your profile picture and select 'New Repository'. On the following page you would name your repository ( for example: 'phase-0' ) choose if you want it to be public or private, which means either anyone can access your repository or you choose who has access. Then select a license if applicable, and click Create Repository.

To clone ( download to your computer ) a repository you would navigate to a repository that you want, copy that repository's URL for example: "https://github.com/Aslonski/phase-0.git" and then in the command line, you would typing the following commands:
* pwd - it will show you where you are in the system, for example lets say it returns " /Users/Andrey/Desktop/ "
* mkdir - will create a new directory. For example mkdir new-repository
* cd new-repository - will switch you to the new-repository directory
and then you would type: git clone https://github.com/Aslonski/phase-0.git
That's it, now you have a copy of that repository on your computer.


**3. Describe what open source means.**

Open Source (also referred to as Free and Open Sourse Software or FOSS) means that you get complete access to the source code of a program, and you can see how the program was made. You have the freedom to copy, delete, modify, or completely change the code as you see fit.


**4. What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?**

I think Open Source is a great way for developers to be involved or to contribute to a very large project like Mozilla's Firefox for example.
It is also a very good source to learn from, because you get access to the heart of the program and you see how it was made and you can learn a lot from it. Imagine if you went to a high end restaurant and the chef would provide you with the recepie i think that would be pretty damn cool! :)

It doesn't make me feel nervous nor protective. I find it exciting.


**5. Assess the importance of using licenses.**

A license is pretty much an official specific permisson for others to use your work. You still hold the original copyright and you are not giving away your rights.
If you don't use a license and just release your work into the public domain
you are pretty much giving up any copyright, and no one is obligated to mention you as the creator or a contributor.
Open Source licenses make it easy for others to contribute to your project and they give you some protection as the original creator, you will get some credit for your work and others won't be able to claimn your work as theirs.

I think it's important to know what license to use and when because there are several different licenses outhere, and each one grants you different rights. And you wan't to make sure you will get credit and recognition for a big project or an idea that you made from scratch, versus some random code you were messing around with that has no significant meaning to you.

Some examples of licenses:

* **GNU General Public License (GPL)** - One of the most common licenses for open source projects. It allows users to legally copy share and modify the software. The only catch is that the other project must also be released under the GPL.
* **MIT License** - The shortest and broadest of all the popular open source licenses. This is the least restrictive license, It basically says that anyone can do whatever they want with the licensed material, as long as it includes the license.
* **Apache License 2.0** - This license can be applied to copyrights and patents. Once you have the rights you can use them forever, they are effective anywhere in the world and completely free of any charge, you can use the licensed work, and so can anyone else and no one can take those rights away once they are granted.


**6. What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?**

I feel the concepts that were reinforced during this challenge were: How to create, clone, push and pull a new repository, add and commit a new file, proper use of the command line and git, and the understanding of open-source licensing and their concept.
I didn't have any particular "aha" moments nor did I struggle with something, everything was pretty straight forward and the instructions were easy to understand.


**7. Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**

I found https://tldrlegal.com to be very useful tool to simplify and understand different lisences.
