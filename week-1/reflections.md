# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

I learned about the Pomodoro Technique and I'm definitely going to try it, and I really liked the Fogg Method and I'm going to try to implement that method into my personal life by creating new tiny habits. One habit that I'm going to start doing is a 30 minute workout right after I come home from work.

"Time Boxing" is a time management tool. You define a set amount of time that you are dedicating to a certain task (similar to the 25min Pomodoro Technique) and when the time is up you stop, and evaluate the work that you've done. I can use it in Phase 0 by setting a time limit on challenges and tasks that I have to complete and thus increasing productivity.

Currently my only time management tool is very vague, I tell myself that I'm going to work on DBC from 5:30pm to 9:30pm every day, and I don't think it's a very good strategy because it is not specific. And I can often find myself going deeper into the rabbit hole of research and the web rather then focusing at the task or challenge at hand.

I'm definitely going to try some of the new strategies mentioned above, and I'm going to try to do some meditation before bed every night. My overall plan is to be more precise with my time by setting specific goals and focusing on each task for a set amount of time.

P.S.

I know reflections supposed to be about a paragraph long, but it just seemed impossible to cram all of that into a paragraph. Please let me know if I can improve my writing. Thanks!

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A Shell is a command line interface that allows the user to manipulate and control the operating system by text commands, and 'Bash' is the interpreter.

The most challenging for me by far was trying to use the "man" (manual) command which basically tells you what a certain command does and how you can use it. I found the syntax and the examples given in those manuals very difficult to read and understand. I had no problem understanding the different commands when they were explained in simple words, and I was able to successfully use all the commands.

I feel like the commands that were covered in the study material were a good solid starting point, and from here on once you know how to navigate around the shell and use the basic commands you can use the manual to learn about other new commands and how they work.


-pwd = print working directory, tells you where you are in the system ( /Users/Andrey/Desktop/ ).

-ls = lists all the files and directories in your current path.

-mv = move or rename a file or a directory.

-cd = change a directory.

-../ = go up a directory.

-touch = create a new file.

-mkdir = create a new directory.

-less = show the content of a file and page through it.

-rmdir = remove a directory.

-rm = remove a file.

-help = gives you the manual for a certain command and how to use it.
