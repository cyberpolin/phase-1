<!--

- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
I really enjoyed the process, it was pretty straight forward and fun, and I liked to see the site coming togehter as I implemented the changes.


- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was fairly easy, there are A LOT of resources out there. The one I used was: http://www.w3schools.com/tags


- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I did well, I didn't do any formatting although I wanted to, I know it's best to leave that to CSS! And I'm very excited to learn all about it next week!


- What seems good and bad about HTML?
The good, is that you can do alot with it, and the syntax is very simple.
The bad, is that you have to type SO MUCH!


- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Personally I translate the tags in my head to a word that is easy to remember so for example for <img src=""> I remember the src as source or search, so it helps me to remember the syntax, or with <a href=""></a> I think about the href part as reference.
It just works for me in my head. :)
